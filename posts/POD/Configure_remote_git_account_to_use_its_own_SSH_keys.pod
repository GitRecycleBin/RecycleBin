=head2 Configure remote git account to use its own SSH keys

B<Next is useful when multiple git accounts would be used on same machine
with multiple SSH keys>.

I<based on: https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996>

=head3 Scenario

Let's play next scenario: on my machine I want to have two github accounts:

    - GitDefault                 # this will be the default git account
    - GitRecycleBin

each using its own set of SSH keys:

    - id_rsa                     # for the GitDefault account
    - id_rsa_2048_recycle_bin    # for the GitRecycleBin account

And of course, I want to have flawless SSH access to different repositories
using these different accounts on same machine.

=head3 Create and configure SSH keys for the B<GitDefault> account

=head3 Create and configure SSH for another github account

Follow: L<https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/>
or shortly:

=over

=item Generate a new SSH key for separate git account

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f id_rsa_2048_recycle_bin

* you may comment the key by the option:

    -C "your_email@example.com" # or whatever is meaningful for you

=item Add the key to the ssh-agent

    $ ssh-add id_rsa_2048_recycle_bin

=item It is good to delete all cached keys before

    $ ssh-add -D

=item Check your active keys

    $ ssh-add -l

=back

=head3 Tell git which key to use with the given account

    $ sudo subl ~/.ssh/config

And add next block

    #GitRecycleBin account
    Host github.com-GitRecycleBin
        HostName github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_2048_recycle_bin

=head3 Configure git repo with GitRecycleBin account

=over

=item Go to your repo root folder

    $ cd ~/projects/RecycleBin/

=item If you have not associated the local repository with a remote:

    $ git remote add origin git@github.com-GitRecycleBin:GitRecycleBin/RecycleBin.git

=item Or edit git config file

    $ subl .git/config

Modify the C<[remote "origin"]> section as:

    [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com-GitRecycleBin:GitRecycleBin/RecycleBin.git

=back

=head3 Test

    $ ssh -T git@github.com-GitRecycleBin

=head4 Debug (if in trouble)

    $ ssh -vT git@github.com-GitRecycleBin



=head3 B<NB!>

You have to perform the above steps for each account you've created,
if you want it to use own SSH key!
